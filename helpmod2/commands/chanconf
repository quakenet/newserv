Handles channel configuration. Chanconf is used to enable and disable H features for a channel.
Most features are configured by their own command but are enabled from chanconf.

Up to 6 values can be disabled or enabled at once.
NOTE: chanconf value 0 (passive mode) completely disables any H activity for a channel, it is provided as a way to disable H without delchan.
