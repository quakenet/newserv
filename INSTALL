newserv Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install newserv you will have to run the configure script:

$ ./configure

The configure script will list any missing dependencies. If you're unsure why
a certain library or header file was not found you can run the configure script
with the -v option or check the .configure.log file after your first configure
run.

Please refer to the "Local Settings" section in this file if you're using
non-standard library/header search paths. Once you've resolved all dependency
issues you can build newserv:

$ make

This might take a while. After all modules are built you can install newserv:

$ make install

By default the newserv binary and the modules are installed into your source
tree. The recommended setup is to now create a separate directory and symlink
the "newserv" binary and the "modules" directory into it:

$ cd
$ mkdir newserv-install && cd newserv-install
$ ln -s ../newserv-src/newserv
$ ln -s ../newserv-src/modules

You will also need to copy the newserv.conf.example configuration file to your
installation directory and rename it to newserv.conf. The MODULES file has a
list of available modules and their configuration settings.

After you have updated your newserv.conf file you can start newserv:

$ ./newserv

newserv does not detach from the console. Consider running it in a
screen(1) session.

User Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a user on your control instance using /msg N hello (where N is
the nick of your control user). You need to be opered and authed in order to
use this command.

If your network does not have an authentication service that supports account
IDs you can load the "auth" module. Note that this module lets opers set
arbitrary account names and IDs and therefore should probably not be loaded on
production networks.

Once you have an account you should have a look at /msg N showcommands for a
list of available commands.

Local Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using non-standard library/include paths you can create a file
called configure.ini.local (using configure.ini.local.example as a template) to
override some of the settings.

Workspaces
~~~~~~~~~

If you're planning to write your own modules you might consider using
workspaces.

For this to work you will need to create a directory for your modules:

$ mkdir custom

Create a skeleton configure.ini in your new module directory:

[modules]
mymodule=

And finally add your workspace to the workspaces.ini file:

[workspaces]
custom=

You will need to re-run configure for it to pick up your new workspace and
whatever modules you have in it.
