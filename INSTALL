newserv Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install newserv you will have to run the configure script:

$ ./configure

The configure script will list any missing dependencies. If you're unsure why
a certain library or header file was not found you can run the configure script
with the -v option or check the .configure.log file after your first configure
run.

Please refer to the "Local Settings" section in this file if you're
using non-standard library/header search paths. Once you've resolved all
dependency issues you can build newserv:

$ make

This might take a while. After all modules are built you can install
newserv:

$ make install

By default the newserv binary and the modules are installed into your
source tree. The recommended setup is to now create a separate directory
and symlink the "newserv" binary and the "modules" directory into it:

$ cd
$ mkdir newserv-install && cd newserv-install
$ mkdir data # Some modules depend on this directory being available
$ ln -s ../newserv-src/newserv
$ ln -s ../newserv-src/modules

You will also need to copy the newserv.conf.example configuration file to your
installation directory and rename it to newserv.conf. The MODULES file
has a list of available modules.

After you have updated your newserv.conf file you can start newserv:

$ ./newserv

newserv does not detach from the console. Consider running it in a
screen(1) session.

Local Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using non-standard library/include paths you can create a file
called configure.ini.local (using configure.ini.local.example as a template)
to override some of the settings.

Workspaces
~~~~~~~~~

If you're planning to write your own modules you might consider using
workspace.

For this to work you will need to create a directory for your modules:

$ mkdir custom

Create a skeleton configure.ini in your new module directory:

[modules]
mymodule=

And finally add your workspace to the workspaces.ini file:

[workspaces]
custom=

You will need to re-run configure for it to pick up your new
workspace and whatever modules you have in it.
